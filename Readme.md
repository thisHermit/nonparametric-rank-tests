# Nonparametric Rank Tests

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **`simulation.ipynb`**, designed for conducting and analyzing non-parametric rank tests. The notebook includes sliders for input parameters and visualizations of the resulting data. The following tests are implemented:

- **Mann-Whitney Test**
- **Van der Waerden Test**
- **Median Test**
- **Friedman-Yates Test**
- **Permutation Test**
- **Two-Sample t-Test**


## Features

- **Input Parameter Setup**: Easily modify and configure the simulation parameters.
- **Simulation Execution**: Runs the simulation logic with efficient data processing.
- **Data Analysis**: Includes scripts for analyzing simulation outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots and graphs to interpret simulation results.
